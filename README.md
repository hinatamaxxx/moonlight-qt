# Moonlight PC v6.2.0 - 旧版のキーボード処理

Moonlight v6.2.0をベースに、キーボードの入力処理を以前のv6.1.0フォークへ戻した非公式Windows x64版です。

キーの割り当て、送信フラグ、半角／全角キーの押下・解放反転を旧版にそろえています。旧版と同じく、反転処理は日本語配列以外や他のOSでも適用されます。v6.2.0のストリーミング操作とキー解放管理は維持しています。旧版以降に追加された変換・無変換キーの割り当てと拡張キーのフラグは、この入力処理では使いません。

既存の[v6.2.0リリース](https://github.com/hinatamaxxx/moonlight-qt/releases/tag/v6.2.0-jp-keyboard-fix.1)のZIPは変更前のものです。更新したソースのビルドは、[Build Custom Windowsの成功した実行](https://github.com/hinatamaxxx/moonlight-qt/actions/workflows/build-custom-windows.yml)から取得できます。

送信イベントを記録するテストで旧版との一致とフォーカス喪失時のキー解放を確認しています。実際のSunshine接続とMicrosoft IME／Google日本語入力での動作は未確認です。半角／全角の長押しでIMEが高速に切り替わる旧版の問題は残る可能性があります。現在のコピーを置き換える前に、別フォルダで試してください。

## English

This unofficial Windows x64 fork keeps Moonlight v6.2.0 and restores the keyboard event handling from the v6.1.0 fork (commit `c13f4a21507b5097d48d9e643b162786336ce982`).

The source branch now uses the previous key mappings, transmission flags, and unconditional Hankaku/Zenkaku event reversal. This also restores the previous behavior on non-Japanese layouts and other platforms. The v6.2.0 stream controls and held-key release mechanism remain available. Conversion-key mappings and extended-key flags added after the old fork are no longer applied by this handler.

The existing [v6.2.0 release](https://github.com/hinatamaxxx/moonlight-qt/releases/tag/v6.2.0-jp-keyboard-fix.1) predates this restoration. Its ZIP has not been replaced. Builds of the updated source are available from successful [Build Custom Windows runs](https://github.com/hinatamaxxx/moonlight-qt/actions/workflows/build-custom-windows.yml).

Input-event parity with the old handler and focus-loss key release are checked with a captured transport. Live Sunshine streaming and Microsoft IME/Google Japanese Input behavior have not been verified. The old issue with rapid IME toggling when holding Hankaku/Zenkaku may remain. Test the build in a separate folder before replacing your current copy.

Implementation assistance: OpenAI Codex. Exact model variant and reasoning setting were not recorded.

## Building

### Windows Build Requirements
* Qt 6.11 SDK or later (earlier versions may work but are not officially supported)
* [Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Community edition is fine)
* Select **MSVC** option during Qt installation. MinGW is not supported.
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (only if building installers for non-development PCs)
* Graphics Tools (only if running debug builds)
  * Install "Graphics Tools" in the Optional Features page of the Windows Settings app.
  * Alternatively, run `dism /online /add-capability /capabilityname:Tools.Graphics.DirectX~~~~0.0.1.0` and reboot.

### macOS Build Requirements
* Qt 6.11 SDK or later (earlier versions may work but are not officially supported)
* Xcode 15 or later (earlier versions may work but are not officially supported)
* [create-dmg](https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg) (only if building DMGs for use on non-development Macs)

### Linux/Unix Build Requirements
* Qt 6 is recommended, but Qt 5.12 or later is also supported (replace `qmake6` with `qmake` when using Qt 5).
* GCC or Clang
* FFmpeg 4.0 or later
* Install the required packages:
  * Debian/Ubuntu:
    * Base Requirements: `libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libopus-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libssl-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libva-dev libvdpau-dev libxkbcommon-dev wayland-protocols libdrm-dev`
    * Qt 6 (Recommended): `qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev libqt6svg6-dev qt6-wayland qml6-module-qtquick-controls qml6-module-qtquick-templates qml6-module-qtquick-layouts qml6-module-qtqml-workerscript qml6-module-qtquick-window qml6-module-qtquick`
    * Qt 5: `qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-layouts qml-module-qtquick-window2 qml-module-qtquick2 qtwayland5`
  * RedHat/Fedora (RPM Fusion repo required):
    * Base Requirements: `openssl-devel SDL2-devel SDL2_ttf-devel ffmpeg-devel libva-devel libvdpau-devel opus-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel alsa-lib-devel libdrm-devel`
    * Qt 6 (Recommended): `qt6-qtsvg-devel qt6-qtdeclarative-devel`
    * Qt 5: `qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-qtquickcontrols2-devel`
* Building the Vulkan renderer requires a `libplacebo-dev`/`libplacebo-devel` version of at least v7.349.0 and FFmpeg 6.1 or later.

### Steam Link Build Requirements
* [Steam Link SDK](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamlink-sdk) cloned on your build system
* STEAMLINK_SDK_PATH environment variable set to the Steam Link SDK path

**Steam Link Hardware Limitations**  
Moonlight builds for Steam Link are subject to hardware limitations of the Steam Link device:
* Maximum resolution: **1080p (1920x1080)**
* Maximum framerate: **60 FPS**
* Maximum video bitrate: **40 Mbps**
* **HDR streaming is not supported** on the original hardware

### Docker containers
If you want to use Docker for building, look at [this repo](https://github.com/cgutman/moonlight-packaging) containing canonical containers
for different architectures, which handle building deps and extra linking for you.

### Build Setup Steps
1. Install the latest Qt SDK (and optionally, the Qt Creator IDE) from https://www.qt.io/download
    * You can install Qt via Homebrew on macOS, but you will need to use `brew install qt --with-debug` to be able to create debug builds of Moonlight.
    * You may also use your Linux distro's package manager for the Qt SDK as long as the packages are Qt 5.12 or later.
    * This step is not required for building on Steam Link, because the Steam Link SDK includes Qt 5.14.
2. Download submodules and dependencies
    * Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` from within `moonlight-qt/`.
    * On Windows and macOS, you must also run `setup-deps.ps1` (Windows) or `setup-deps.py` (macOS).
    * Perform these steps each time you pull new changes from the Git repository.
3. Open the project in Qt Creator or build from qmake on the command line.
    * To build a binary for use on non-development machines, use the scripts in the `scripts` folder.
        * For Windows builds, use `scripts\build-arch.bat` and `scripts\generate-bundle.bat`. Execute these scripts from the root of the repository within a Qt command prompt. Ensure  7-Zip binary directory is on your `%PATH%`.
        * For macOS builds, use `scripts/generate-dmg.sh`. Execute this script from the root of the repository and ensure Qt's `bin` folder is in your `$PATH`.
        * For Steam Link builds, run `scripts/build-steamlink-app.sh` from the root of the repository.
    * To build from the command line for development use on macOS or Linux, run `qmake6 moonlight-qt.pro` then `make debug` or `make release`.
        * The final binary will be placed in `app/moonlight`.
    * To create an embedded build for a single-purpose device, use `qmake6 "CONFIG+=embedded" moonlight-qt.pro` and build normally.
        * This build will lack windowed mode, Discord/Help links, and other features that don't make sense on an embedded device.
        * For platforms with poor GPU performance, add `"CONFIG+=gpuslow"` to prefer direct KMSDRM rendering over GL/Vulkan renderers. Direct KMSDRM rendering can use dedicated YUV/RGB conversion and scaling hardware rather than slower GPU shaders for these operations.
